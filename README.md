# Webprogramming
This is a collection of generative art made for my webprogramming class.
The document names are the page numbers they can be found under in my report.
I made those short projects as tools to teach myself some basics in coding.
It was a fun way to try out new functions with every small project.
I am planning on trying out some more things in the future that I haven't had the time to learn yet within those 7 weeks.
One thing for example that I would really love to create is spheres randomly moving around in a 3D space and then getting in position to recreate an image when a button is pressed.
I am also planning on continuing working on my sinus curve projects as they didn't work out the way I wanted them to yet.
